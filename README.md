# public-python-packages

Centralised hosting for public python packages (eg. that aren't hosted on pypi)

## Brainstem

There is no public package on pypi: https://pypi.org/project/brainstem/

Instead, you have to [download their SDK](https://acroname.com/software/brainstem-development-kit) and extract the `.whl` files (now hosted here)
